Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  This project began with starter code. The code laid out the environment including the maze, the treasure, and the obstacles that would be utilized in the game.  All methods and framework of the project were already included before the project began. There was a ToDo section in the original code that created an area where I filled in code. This section is what trained the model on how to win the game. This section allowed variables to be changed like epoch, epsilon, and batch number. The balance of values is what allowed the agent to ultimately win. 
  This project was to be approached thoughtfully. Making took rash decisions would cause the agent to ultimately fail. Deciding what balance of values allowed the treasure to be found in the end. Approaching a problem systematically and thoroughly is important for growth and success. When viewing projects like this, utilizing an ethical lens is extremely important. The ultimate success of the project could be tragically hindered if machine learning is allowed to be tainted by bias, for example. As long as GDPR regulations are followed, machine learning can be very beneficial for human beings to aid in problem solving in the future.
